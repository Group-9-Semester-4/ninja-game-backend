# Ninja Game Backend
This readme will contain all information needed to work with the backend, and any backend related tasks etc.
# Code standards:
We aim to adhere to the usual java convention (Classes start with uppercase, methods w/ lowercase etc.)  
We use `camelCase` for names within files (methods, variables) _example:_ findByUuid  
Files should follow `PascalCase` _example:_ GameService
